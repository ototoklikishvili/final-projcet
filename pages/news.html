        <h1 class="h11">The History of perfume:</h1>
        <h3 class="h33">Ancient Egypt (c. 3000 BCE):</h3>

        <p class="np">
          The Egyptians are often credited with developing the first true
          perfumes. They used aromatic oils, herbs, and resins in religious
          rituals, personal care, and for embalming. The process involved
          distilling flowers and other plants to extract their oils. The
          Egyptians also created perfume bottles, some of which were finely
          crafted and used for storing precious oils. One of the earliest
          recorded uses of perfume in Egypt was for Cleopatra, who was known to
          wear fragrant oils.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h333">Ancient Mesopotamia (c. 2000 BCE):</h3>
        <p class="np2">
          The Sumerians and Babylonians in Mesopotamia also created early
          perfumes, using spices, resins, and flowers. They produced fragrances
          by heating or pressing the plants, and the resulting scents were often
          used in religious ceremonies and personal hygiene.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h333">Ancient Greece and Rome (c. 500 BCE – 300 CE):</h3>
        <p class="np2">
          The Greeks and Romans further refined the art of perfumery. The Greeks
          were influenced by the Egyptians and began to develop their own
          fragrant oils and ointments. The Romans popularized the use of
          perfumes, incorporating them into daily life. They also created the
          first "perfume bottles" as we know them today, often made from glass.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h333">The Middle Ages (5th–15th Century):</h3>
        <p class="np2">
          During the Middle Ages, perfume-making was largely associated with the
          Islamic world. Islamic scholars and chemists, such as Avicenna, made
          significant advancements in distillation techniques, allowing for the
          extraction of pure essential oils from flowers, herbs, and spices.
          This made perfume production more efficient and accessible. The use of
          perfume spread to Europe through trade with the Arabs.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h333">
          The Renaissance and Modern Era (16th Century onward)
        </h3>
        <p class="np2">
          In the 16th century, perfume became an important part of European
          court life, particularly in France and Italy. The art of
          perfume-making continued to evolve, with the introduction of
          alcohol-based perfumes in the 17th century. One of the most famous
          early perfumes was "Eau de Cologne," created by the Italian-born
          perfumer Johann Maria Farina in 1709. His fragrance, which was light
          and citrus-based, became a sensation and set the foundation for modern
          perfumery. Thus, the history of perfume is a long and rich one,
          involving many cultures and innovations, and has evolved into the
          sophisticated industry we know today.
